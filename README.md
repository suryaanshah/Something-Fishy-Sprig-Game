The objective of the game is to catch the fish by using the net. The net falls down due to gravity, and the user has to strategically press `w` to pull the net up and maintain the overlap between fish and the net. That is, the fish must be *inside* the net.

Controls can be switched from only :arrow_up_down: to *also* include :left_right_arrow: by pressing `i`.  In that case, the fish can also move horizontally. 

Your score and chances of catching increases as the overlap of the net and the fish is maintained, and starts decreasing if the overlap is no longer there. 

The fish is caught when the score reaches 100!

## How to play
The game can be played by installing it on Sprig. Alternatively, you can play the game [*here*](https://sprig.hackclub.com/share/Lu2mRZxMfGeqyhCmWaoN) at Sprig's website. Press, `Shift + Enter`, and press `s` to start.

### Controls
The following key-direction pair is followed in the game:
+ `d` - denotes move-right
+ `a` - denotes move-left
+ `w` - denotes move-up

You control the net, and try to overlap it with where the fish moves.

*Note*: If you had selected :arrow_up_down: , then only `w` key will work. Accordingly the fish will also only move unidirectiionally.
