The objective of the game is to catch the fish, but using the net. The net falls down due to gravity, and the user has to press `w` to pull the net up and maintain the overlap between fish and the net. 

The score increases as the overlap is maintained by the user, and decreases as the overlap is no longer there. 

The fish is caught when the score reaches 100!
